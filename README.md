# Weather-Node

## Project from _"The Complete Node.js Developer Course (2nd Edition)"_ by Andew Mead

This program is a command line interface for getting the weather of a certain location, implementing [google's geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro) and [Dark Sky's forecast API](https://darksky.net/dev).

It takes in an address as an argument and returns the current weather conditions of that area (using longitude and latitude).
Most of the code is written under the guidance of the class.

I also decided to have some fun and implemented a 'default location' to return the weather of when you call the app-promise.js with no flags, set using the _-d_ flag.
